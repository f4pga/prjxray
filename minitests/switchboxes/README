Some small tests with PIPs. Lists all the PIPs in a regular CLB and INT tile.

None of the PIPs in the CLB are "real". Some are 1:1 connections that are
"always on" and the others are simply implemented by permuting the LUT init
values.

Probably only works for with the Artix 7 settings because contains
hardcoded slice addresses.
