Experiment looking into the CLB PIPs
====================================

None of the CLB PIPs are "real". I.e. all those PIPs are in fact implemented
using other resources. E.g. the PIPs that select which net is routed to which
LUT input pin is implemented by permutating the LUT INIT bits accordingly.
